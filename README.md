## 4 - Algorithms & optimizations

- ### Negamax

  The negamax algorithm is a variant of the minimax algorithm that simplifies the implementation of two-player games. It assumes that both players are playing optimally and tries to maximize the score for the current player while minimizing it for the opponent.

  It works by recursively exploring the game tree, evaluating the positions, and returning the best move for the current player.

## 5 - Benchmark

- ### Testsets

  To benchmark the different algorithms, I've created 6 datasets from [here](http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/02-test-protocol/) and placed them in the <a href="tests/data/">data</a> directory.

  Here are the datasets:

  | Test Set (1000 test cases each) | Test Set name |     nb moves      |  nb remaining moves   |
  | :-----------------------------: | :-----------: | :---------------: | :-------------------: |
  |           Test_L1_S1            |  Easy-Begin   |    moves <= 11    |    remaining <= 11    |
  |           Test_L1_S2            |  Easy-Middle  | 12 <= moves <= 21 |    remaining <= 11    |
  |           Test_L1_S3            |   Easy-End    | 22 <= moves <= 31 |    remaining <= 11    |
  |           Test_L2_S2            | Medium-Begin  |    moves <= 11    | 12 <= remaining <= 30 |
  |           Test_L2_S3            | Medium-Middle | 12 <= moves <= 21 | 12 <= remaining <= 30 |
  |           Test_L3_S1            |  Hard-Begin   |    moves <= 11    | 31 <= remaining <= 42 |

- ### Results

  I ran the tests on each algorithm and collected the results in a CSV file and computed the **mean** for each category.

  Here are the algorithms ranked from the most efficient to the least efficient:

  | Rank | Algorithm | Search time | Number of positions | Time per position | Positions per second |
  | :--: | :-------: | :---------: | :-----------------: | :---------------: | :------------------: |
  |  1   |           |             |                     |                   |                      |
  |  2   |           |             |                     |                   |                      |
  |  3   |           |             |                     |                   |                      |
  |  4   |           |             |                     |                   |                      |
  |  5   |           |             |                     |                   |                      |
  |  6   |           |             |                     |                   |                      |
  |  7   |  Negamax  |             |                     |                   |                      |
